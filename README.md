Prints a Shakespearean Sonnet when you Open a Terminal.

Current known issues:
One of the sonnets has 13 lines.

# How to run
1. Place the shakespeare folder in a directory called shakespeare
2. Modify .bashrc to include a call to shakespeare (./shakespeare/shakespeare)
3. If you want to use text-to-speech then install Festival (or do your own thing)
